## Personal Learnings

### Web Developer (Project 5)

This is a project produced from the following lesson from Week 8:

1. Ajax in WordPress & WP Rest API

Below are the subsequent learning outcomes.

I learned that if I cannot see which WordPress template I am currently viewing for styling, I can still use the Dev Tools to find page specific elements to style.
